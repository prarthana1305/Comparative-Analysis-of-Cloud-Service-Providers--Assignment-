# Comparative Analysis of Cloud Service Providers

## Objective
In this assignment, I compared the major cloud service providers—AWS, Azure, GCP, Akamai Linode—by evaluating their offerings, pricing models, and target audience.

## Methodology
- **Evaluate service offerings**: Analyzed services in categories such as compute, storage, and AI/ML.
- **Pricing models**: Deconstructed pricing models including On-Demand, Reserved Instances, etc.
- **Target audience**: Analyzed suitability for startups, SMBs, and enterprises.
- **Cost evaluation**: Used each cloud provider's pricing calculator to estimate costs for both development and production environments.

## Summary
This comparison helped in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each platform and how they cater to different needs.
